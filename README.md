🔭 Currently building
- **Vital Registration System** — secure, offline-capable platform for birth & death registration with role-based workflows and audit trails.
- **Citizen Feedback App** — mobile + web platform for collecting, routing, and tracking citizen feedback on public services (SMS / WhatsApp gateway support).

🛠 Tech & focus
- Core: TypeScript · Node.js · React · mobile (React Native / Flutter) · PostgreSQL · Docker
- Design priorities: offline-first mobile UX, privacy-by-design, role-based access control (RBAC), auditability, operational reliability

✨ What I build
I design and ship deployable systems for governments and public institutions: data-efficient mobile forms, resilient sync for intermittent networks, clear backend APIs, and dashboards that help teams act on citizen feedback. I work closely with policy and operations leads to ensure solutions are maintainable and deliver measurable impact.

📁 Featured projects
- Vital Registration — Offline capture, secure sync, role approvals, exportable reporting. Key tech: React Native, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis.  
  Quick actions: open an issue to request architecture notes or propose integrations.
- Citizen Feedback App — Anonymous + authenticated reporting, routing & SLA tracking, officer dashboards. Key tech: React, Node.js, Docker.  
  Quick actions: see CONTRIBUTING.md for how to run locally and test integrations.
- (Add project) — One-line summary. Key tech: Tech1, Tech2. Live demo: https://example-demo.example

How I work
- Start from real workflows (low bandwidth, low literacy, offline constraints).
- Prioritize privacy, encryption, and audit trails.
- Deliver maintainable solutions governments can operate and scale.

Principles & priorities
- Offline-first UX and efficient sync for intermittent networks.
- Privacy-by-design: minimize data collection, encrypt at rest/in-transit, provide audit trails.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and clear operational playbooks for admins.

Quick checklist to make the profile even stronger
1. Pin 4–6 polished repos (complete demos or well-documented libraries).
2. Add screenshots or a short GIF of each featured project (place in /assets and reference here).
3. Add badges to project READMEs (CI, coverage, license, demo link).
4. Add CONTRIBUTING.md and a basic GitHub Actions workflow for CI in each active repo.
5. Replace placeholder links above with the exact repo URLs and live demo URLs.

Replace placeholders
- Update the GitHub stats badge to use any theme you like (see https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/).
- Replace "(Add project)" lines with the real repo name and URL.
- Put screenshots in this repo under /assets and reference them in the Featured projects section.

Thanks for sharing your content — I consolidated, styled, and added actionable elements so your profile tells a clearer story to maintainers, government partners, and contributors. If you want, I can now:
- swap in exact repo links and screenshots,
- generate CONTRIBUTING.md and a sample GitHub Actions CI file for one project,
- or create polished README templates for each project with setup, architecture diagram suggestions, and deploy notes.
